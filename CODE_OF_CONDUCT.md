# Code of Conduct — Aegis FraudStream

## Purpose
Aegis FraudStream is a professional, open, and inclusive project. This Code of Conduct sets clear expectations for behavior, outlines reporting processes, and describes enforcement to keep all contributors safe and respected.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Positive examples of behavior:
- Demonstrate empathy and kindness.
- Respect differing opinions and experiences.
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the community and project.
- Use inclusive, professional language.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language.
- Sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, reviews, or events.
- Unconsented AI-generated impersonation or deepfakes of community members.

## Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces (GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, chat, events, conferences, social media) and whenever an individual officially represents the project.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers and moderators must:
- Clarify and enforce standards consistently and fairly.
- Take corrective action for unacceptable behavior.
- Safeguard reporter privacy to the fullest extent possible.
- Recuse themselves from cases where they have a conflict of interest.

## Reporting
Report violations to:
- Primary contact: alanusp • alanursapu@gmail.com
- Security/disclosure: see `SECURITY_CONTACTS` or `.well-known/security.txt`

What to include:
- Your contact info.
- Where the incident occurred (links, screenshots).
- What happened, when, and whether it is ongoing.
- Any prior context and requested outcome.

Confidentiality:
- Reports are kept private within the small moderation team.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a timeline for next steps.
- Retaliation against reporters or witnesses is prohibited.

Emergency:
- If you or someone else is in immediate danger, contact local authorities first.

## Enforcement Process
The moderation team will:
1) Acknowledge the report and confirm understanding.
2) Assess risk, collect context, and hear from involved parties.
3) Decide on actions proportionate to impact and history.
4) Communicate the outcome to relevant parties, respecting privacy.

### Enforcement Guidelines
- **Correction**: Community impact low. Action: private feedback; request behavior change.
- **Warning**: Single incident with measurable impact. Action: written warning; conditions for continued participation.
- **Temporary Suspension**: Repeated or significant impact. Action: time-bound ban from community spaces; conditions for return.
- **Permanent Ban**: Pattern of abuse or severe violations (e.g., threats, harassment, doxxing). Action: permanent removal from all project channels and contribution venues.

Appeals:
- You may appeal a decision within 14 days by replying to the decision message with new or clarifying information. A different moderator will review when feasible.

## Community Expectations
- Keep discussions on topic and actionable.
- Use respectful review language; prefer “suggest” over “demand.”
- Disclose conflicts of interest when relevant.
- Protect sensitive data; do not post secrets, personal data, or non-public information.
- Follow repository contribution norms, license terms, and applicable laws.

## Maintainers’ Additional Duties
- Label and triage issues/PRs without bias.
- Avoid “drive-by closes” without explanation.
- Provide clear upgrade and deprecation notices.
- Ensure accessibility of docs and communications.

## Event and Meeting Policy
- Share agendas and notes when possible.
- Obtain consent before recording.
- Provide inclusive time slots or asynchronous alternatives.

## Anti-Harassment & Safe Communication
- No slurs, stereotypes, or microaggressions.
- No unwanted advances or repeated contact.
- If asked to stop any behavior, do so immediately.

## Transparency
- Aggregate statistics on reports may be published periodically without identifying details.
- Moderation membership and escalation paths will be documented in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Updates
This Code may be revised to improve clarity and effectiveness. Material changes will be announced via repository CHANGELOG or Discussions.
